# Linear_Regression

Linear Regression is a statistical technique used to find the relationship between 2 variables. In Machine Learning concept, Linear Regression finds relationship between features and labels.

In this project, I looked at songs and tried to predict their rank (like how popular they are) based on other things, such as:

How well they did last week.
The highest rank they reached before.
How many weeks they’ve been on the chart.
Who the singer (artist) is.

So, if we have a song that has a certain last week’s rank and weeks on the chart, we can use our magical ruler (linear regression) to guess its current rank.
